Here is the candidate's CV text:
-------------
{cv_text}
-------------
Extract and return ONLY a JSON array of skills, each containing:
- skill_name (the name of the skill; always required)
- skill_level (the level of proficiency or certification if specified, otherwise null)
- description (short context or details about the skill if present, otherwise null)

Output a strictly valid JSON array, for example:
[
  {
    "skill_name": "ABAP",
    "skill_level": "expert",
    "description": "10+ years experience developing SAP modules"
  },
  {
    "skill_name": "Team Leadership",
    "skill_level": null,
    "description": null
  }
]
If the "description" field is not present in the text, try to infer a short, relevant description for each skill using the context of the CV (for example, based on the candidateâ€™s previous projects, roles, or responsibilities). If you cannot reasonably infer a description, set it to null.

If no skills are found, return an empty array [].
Do not include any explanations, comments, or other information.
